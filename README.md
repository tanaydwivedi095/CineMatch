# CineMatch: AI-Powered Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
CineMatch is an **AI-powered movie recommendation system** that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. Using **content-based filtering** and **cosine similarity**, CineMatch analyzes movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, director, etc.) to suggest similar films to the userâ€™s favorite movie.

This intelligent recommendation system helps movie enthusiasts discover new films by analyzing textual movie features and recommending the most relevant matches.

## Features
### âœ… Intelligent Movie Recommendations
- Generates personalized movie recommendations based on user input.

### âœ… Content-Based Filtering
- Uses **genres, keywords, tagline, cast, and director** to match similar movies.

### âœ… Cosine Similarity Matching
- Computes similarity scores between movies using **TF-IDF vectorization**.

### âœ… Efficient Searching & Ranking
- Finds the closest matching movie title and recommends **top 30** most similar films.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**
   - The user enters their favorite movie title.
2. **Text Feature Extraction**
   - Extracts key textual features (genres, keywords, tagline, cast, director) from the movie dataset.
3. **TF-IDF Vectorization**
   - Converts text features into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**.
4. **Similarity Computation**
   - Computes the similarity between movies using **cosine similarity**.
5. **Recommendation Output**
   - Returns the **top 30 most similar movies** based on feature similarity.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and CSV handling.
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn** â€“ Machine learning toolkit for **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity**.
- **difflib** â€“ Finds closest movie title matches.

## Installation
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanaydwivedi095/CineMatch.git
cd CineMatch
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Step 3: Run the Application
To start the recommender system, execute:
```bash
python cine_match.py
```

## Usage
1. **Run the script** and enter your favorite movie name.
2. The system will find the closest matching movie title.
3. It will then recommend **30 similar movies** based on metadata similarity.
4. The program allows multiple queries in a loop until the user exits.

### Example Interaction
#### **User Input:**
```
Enter your favorite movie name: Inception
```
#### **Recommended Movies:**
```
Movies suggested for you:
1. Interstellar
2. The Prestige
3. Shutter Island
4. Memento
5. The Matrix
...
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Combining content-based and collaborative filtering for better recommendations.
- **Real-Time Movie API Integration**: Fetching updated movie data from IMDB or TMDB.
- **Web Interface**: Creating a user-friendly web-based recommendation platform.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Exploring NLP-based movie recommendation using transformers.
